# Dice

## A six sided dice

This was a quick project created in order to finish a homework assignment for my oldest daugther. 
We were supposed to play a math game but we couldn't find a dice. Therefore a created this simple 
app so we could play the game. 


It is a super simple app, but it got the job done, and hey isn't great when you can solve the lack of
a dice with code ðŸš€
